# Xamarin.Android csc "default interface methods" support.

The latest mono master builds csc "dim" version. It will be installed as
`$prefix/lib/mono/4.5/dim/csc.exe` etc.

This project is to build a nuget package that simplifies use of the new
compiler. Add `xamarin.android.csc.dim` package, and set your C# language
version to the "latest", and you're good to go.
